# dumb\_lib.h

This is a single-file (or "header-only") MIT licensed library for C/C++,
meant primarily for:
+ A) My personal use, as a "C extension"/my own "standart library"
+ B) My own learning purposes

That means that the library is still very much "under construction",
and also, that I will most likely not accept any pull requests.
(I may change my mind on that, obviously)

Thus, I ask you: if you want to use it, **READ THROUGH THE CODE, VALIDATE IT,**
**TEST IT OUT YOURSELF AND TAKE THE "NO WARRANTY..." PART OF THE LICENSE SERIOUSLY.**

(For this reason, I may never take this lib over the v1.0 mark - we'll see)

### NOTES

If you're wondering why there are no "//" comments, it's because they are not part
of the C89 standart. For rationale to comply with C89 see [Dependable C](https://www.dependablec.org/)

If you are wondering why I decided to use single-header style for the library, see [Sean Barrett's explanation](https://github.com/nothings/stb?tab=readme-ov-file#why-single-file-headers)
